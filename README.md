Dear Sir/Madam,

# Gale-Shapley-algorithm is an implementation of Gale-Shapley algorithm as an especial solution of stable marriage problem by MATLAB with GUI.
This implementations are responses to question 1 in a homework (Homework1.pdf) with permission of publicatoin (Permission of publicationpdf).

A brief explanation of each file:
InputGenerator.m: It provides n * n two random preference lists of men and women in a text file
GALE_SHAPLEY.m: It gets a text file containing n, and two preference lists (the output of InputGenerator.m) and provides a solution based on GALE-SHAPLEY.
StabilityChecking.m: It gets Input and Output text files of GALE-SHAPLEY and checks the stability of matches in the output based on the inputs.
For the rest of files please refer to the Homework1.pdf and files.

I hope this implementation helps you.
